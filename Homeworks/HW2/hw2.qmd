::: {.callout-caution title="Goals"}
The goal of this homework is to practice some basic data exploration and data viz in guided settings.
:::



## Exercise 0

### Part a

We'll be using some data stored in the `mosaic`, `mosaicData` and `fivethirtyeight` packages. Follow the instructions from Activity 3 to:

-   Check whether you already have these packages.
-   If not, install them.

### Part b

```{r}
# Load packages we'll need for HW 2: tidyverse, mosaic, fivethirtyeight (mosaicData will be loaded automatically when loading the mosaic package)
library(mosaic)
library(mosaicData)
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(tidyverse)
```


## Exercise 1

The `Birthdays` dataset in the `mosaic` package includes information on births in the United States. Run the chunk below which *wrangles* this information into a new dataset, `daily_births`, which records the total number of `births` per day in the U.S. between 1969 and 1988.

::: {.callout-important title="Instructions"}

Use `daily_births`, not `Birthdays` in the exercises.

:::


```{r}
# Create the daily_births dataset
# Don't worry about the code. We'll learn this in the next unit!
data("Birthdays")
daily_births <- Birthdays |> 
  group_by(date) |> 
  summarize(births = sum(births)) |> 
  mutate(year = year(date), 
         month = month(date, label = TRUE),
         day_of_month = mday(date),
         day_of_week = wday(date, label = TRUE))
```

### Part a

Let's get to know the data! Complete the tasks indicated by each comment in the chunk below. Put your code directly after the relevant comment.

```{r}
# Determine the number of data points we have
#7305 Datapoints
dim(daily_births)

# Check out the first 6 rows of the dataset
head(daily_births)

# Check out the structure / class of each variable in the dataset (1 line of code)
str(daily_births)
# Each line observation is the number of births from 1969 to 1988. Their is numerical/integer variables year day_of_month and births and other information about the month and day of the week


```



### Part b

Notice from your work in part a that `day_of_week` and `month` are special types of *categorical* variables: `Ord.factors` or **ordinal factors**. Explain what makes `day_of_week` and `month` *ordinal*.

::: {.callout-important title="Instructions"}



:::

::: {.callout-note title="Answer"}

An ordinal variable is a categorical variable where the order of the catagories matter. For day_of_week and month the order of the day_of_week the order is important since that is the order that time passes.

:::




### Part c

What are the units of observation?

::: {.callout-note title="Answer"}

Each unit of observation is one day and the data ranges for every day from 1969 to 1988.

:::



## Exercise 2

Our general goal is to understand how births vary from day to day. Let's start by focusing on just the `births` variable.

### Part a

Construct *two* plots of `births`. Each plot should use a different layer / geometric element.

```{r}
# Plot 1
ggplot(daily_births, aes(x = births)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "skyblue")

```

```{r}
# Plot 2
daily_births %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(total_births = sum(births)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = total_births)) +
  geom_col(fill = "skyblue")
```

### Part b

Summarize your observations about daily births in the U.S. Tell a *cohesive* story here (not a list of distinct observations) that incorporates important aspects of quantitative variables: range, distribution / shape, typical outcome, outliers.

::: {.callout-note title="Answer"}

My visualizations help show which months have the most and least amount of births. It sums the total number of births in those months over all of the years of data. The late summer and early fall months have the most births while november and febuary have the least births. My histogram bins the days and shows the distribution of births in a day. It shows that their are usually between 8000 and 11500 births in a day.

:::



## Exercise 3

Your plots above illustrate that there's something interesting happening here! Perhaps it can be explained by changes in birth rates over *time*. For example, we might wonder: Have births increased or decreased? Have there been any peaks or valleys in births? Are there any seasonal trends?

### Part a

Construct a plot of births over time. Only use 2 variables in your plot and make sure that every data point is represented in the plot (not just a summary of trends). We'll come back to this later.

```{r}
ggplot(daily_births, aes(x = date, y = births)) +
  geom_point()

```

### Part b

Summarize your observation about births over time. Be sure to comment on the following:

-   What are the longer-term birth trends over time (on the scale of years)?
-   Are there any seasonal trends within years (on the scale of months)?
-   What other interesting or unusual patterns do you notice?!?

::: {.callout-note title="Answer"}

Their seems to be a seasonal trend of births which most likely is in the summer based on the graph from the exercise before. It seems like birth rates dropped in the early 70's and steadily rose after 1975 to 1989. This is interesting and I would most likely attribute this to the status of the economy. The early 1970's was during stagflation and after that the economy recovered and was very healthy in the 1980's.

:::



## Exercise 4

Your above plot of births over time has an interesting pattern: there seem to be 2-3 distinct groups of points. Let's sleuth it out.

### Part a

Starting from your plot of births over time from above, add a new scale / variable that explains the distinction between the distinct groups. 

::: {.callout-important title="Instructions"}

Use your intuition--What variables do we have that might explain the 2 groups? and play around. If you get stuck, move on to Exercise 5 and come back.

:::

```{r}
ggplot(daily_births, aes(x = date, y = births, color = day_of_week)) +
  geom_point()
```

### Part b

Explain in words *what* is going on here (e.g. "over time, there tend to be more births on... than on....") and *why* you think this is happening. NOTE: The "why" might be challenging, so just do your best.

::: {.callout-note title="Answer"}

I think that the groups of high births and low birth can be separated out by day of the week. Saturday and Sunday are much lower and Mon-Fri are much higher which is shown clearly from the colors in the graph. 

:::



## Exercise 5

Let's dig into weekly and monthly birth trends.

### Part a

Construct 2 plots that illustrate how birth rates might vary by month, one using density plots and another using boxplots. One of these will be more useful than the other!

```{r}
ggplot(daily_births, aes(x = births, fill = month)) +
  geom_density()

ggplot(daily_births, aes(x = month, y = births, fill = month)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

### Part b

Construct a plot that illustrates how birth rates might vary by day of the week.

```{r}
ggplot(daily_births, aes(x = day_of_week, y = births, fill = day_of_week)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

### Part c

Summarize your observations from parts a and b. Do birth rates tend to be higher in some months than others? Or higher on some days of the weeks than others? Explain. 

::: {.callout-important title="Instructions"}

If you skipped Exercise 4, you now have the hints.

:::

::: {.callout-note title="Answer"}

I talked about this earlier but from that graph it seems like July and August have more births then the other months.

:::



## Exercise 6

In the remaining exercises, we'll explore new data. The "Bechdel test" tests whether movies meet the following criteria:

-   there are at least 2 characters that identify as women
-   these characters talk to each other
-   at least 1 time, they talk about something other than men

In the fivethirtyeight.com article ["The Dollar-And-Cents Case Against Hollywood's Exclusion of Women"](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/), the authors analyze which Hollywood movies do/don't pass the test. Their data are available in the `fivethirtyeight` package\
Run the chunk below which *wrangles* this information into a new dataset, `new_bechdel`, which tidies up some of the categorical variables.

```{r}
# Create the new_bechdel dataset
# Don't worry about the code. We'll learn this in the next unit!
data(bechdel)
new_bechdel <- bechdel |>
  mutate(clean_test = factor(clean_test, c("nowomen", "notalk", "men", "dubious", "ok"))) |>
  mutate(half_decades = cut(year, breaks = seq(1969, 2014, by = 5)))
```

::: {.callout-important title="Instructions"}

-   Use `new_bechdel`, not `bechdel` in the exercises.
-   Before using the `new_bechdel` data, check out the codebook by typing `?bechdel` in the **CONSOLE**.

:::

### Part a

Construct a plot that addresses the following research question: Do bigger budgets (`budget_2013`) pay off with greater box office returns (`domgross_2013`)? In constructing this plot:

-   Include a layer that represents each individual film in the dataset. There are a lot of data points, so use transparency to improve the visualization.
-   Include a layer that highlights the *trends* in this relationship.
-   Pay attention to which of these is the *response* variable and which is the *predictor*.

```{r}
ggplot(new_bechdel, aes(x = budget_2013, y = domgross_2013)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red")

```

### Part b

Create new plot, which tweaks the plot in part a, that addresses the following research question: Does the dependence of box office returns on budget differ among films that do and do not pass the Bechdel test? In examining the Bechdel test, use a variable that simply captures PASS or FAIL for each film.

```{r}
ggplot(new_bechdel, aes(x = budget_2013, y = domgross_2013, color = binary)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

### Part c

Summarize your observations about the relationship between box office returns and budget, and how (if at all) this differs between films that do and do not pass the Bechdel test.

::: {.callout-note title="Answer"}

The graph shows that movies that pass the test see more of a return on movie spending then movies that do not. However, for low budget movies those who fail make slightly more on average.

:::



## Exercise 7

The `clean_test` variable goes into more detail than the `binary` variable. Not only does it indicate whether a film passes the test, it indicates *why* a failing film fails. Read more about it in the codebook.

### Part a

Construct a plot of the `clean_test` variable that allows us to explore the number of films that fall into each category.

```{r}
ggplot(new_bechdel, aes(x = clean_test, fill = clean_test)) +
  geom_bar()
```

### Part b

Among films that fail the Bechdel test, what's the primary reason?

::: {.callout-note title="Answer"}

The primary reason that movies fail the test that the women in the movie do not talk.

:::



### Part c

Consider two more questions: How are the films in the data set distributed across half decades, i.e. 5-year periods (`half_decades`)? And within each `half_decade`, how are the films distributed across Bechdel categories (`clean_test`)? Construct a single plot that answers both of these questions. Your y-axis should reflect *counts*, i.e. numbers of movies.

```{r}
ggplot(new_bechdel, aes(x = half_decades, fill = clean_test)) +
  geom_bar(position = "stack")
```



## Exercise 8

NOTE: The following exercise is inspired by a similar exercise by Albert Kim, a `fivethirtyeight` package co-author.

The plot in Exercise 7 illustrates that more of the films in our dataset are more recent, but it's not easy to examine the breakdown of the Bechdel test in each 5-year period. To that end, return to the fivethirtyeight.com article (linked above and in the codebook) and examine the plot titled "The Bechdel Test Over Time".

### Part a

Summarize the trends captured by this plot. (How has the representation of women in movies evolved over time?)

::: {.callout-note title="Answer"}

I am having a hard time finding this article.
:::



### Part b

Recreate this plot from the article!  Your plot won't look *exactly* like the authors', but should be close to that below. You'll need to add the following layer to get a similar color scheme:

```{r eval=FALSE}
scale_fill_manual(values = c("red", "salmon", "pink", "steelblue1", "steelblue4"))
```

```{r, out.width = "800px",echo=FALSE, fig.alt='Proportional barplot of Bechdel test results across 5 year time periods. An increasing number of movies pass the Bechdel test over time but still only make up about 50% of the movies in the most recent time period.'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://mac-stat.github.io/images/112/bechdel_hist.png")
```

```{r fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5.5}

```
